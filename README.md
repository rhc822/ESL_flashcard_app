# ESL Flashcard App
##### The modern, digital version of the traditional flashcard-style study method, geared towards English as a Second Language learners.

## What is the ESL Flashcard App?

Mastering a new language is more than mere understanding. A lot of work goes into ingraining new words into a person’s lexicon. In addition, words themselves aren’t used in isolation. They’re embedded in a greater context of phrases and sentences. There’s no way around it: repetition is required before words are usable "on the fly". This app provides a way for learners to have a place to capture words and sentences they encounter on web pages into a flash card-like web app for easy review. They can then organize these cards into categories and practice testing themselves.
